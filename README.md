# Reviving the Legend of Drakolimni in a VR Environment

## Overview
This project is my integrated master's thesis for my Computer Science and Engineering degree. A virtual reality application was developed using Unity3D to bring to life the legend of the dragons surrounding the alpine lakes of Drakolimni in the Epirus mountain ranges of Greece. The project leverages 3D scenes and models to provide users with a realistic and immersive experience of the landscape and its myths. 

Key features include detailed environmental rendering, folklore integration, and interactive storytelling elements to enhance user engagement and presence in the virtual world. Special attention is given to interactions within the VR environment to effectively bridge virtual and physical realities.
